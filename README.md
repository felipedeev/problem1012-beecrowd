# problem1012-beecrowd

When starting to solve Beecrowd problem 1012, I came across the description that involved calculating areas of different geometric shapes. I looked closely at the requirements: calculating the area of ​​a triangle, a circle, a trapezoid, a square, and a rectangle, all with specific input values.

Initially, I revisited the formulas to calculate the area of ​​each geometric figure. Remember the formula for the triangle (base * height) / 2, for the circle (π * radius²), for the trapezoid ((larger base + smaller base) * height) / 2, for the square (side * side) and for the rectangle (base * height) was crucial to start with.

I then planned my code, deciding to use variables to store the given input values ​​and apply the correct formulas to calculate the areas of each geometric shape.

During code implementation, I chose a language that would allow me to easily express these mathematical calculations. I created variables to store the input values ​​and used the appropriate formulas to calculate the areas of each figure, ensuring accuracy in the calculations.

After finishing coding, I ran tests with different sets of values ​​to verify that the code produced the correct results. This was essential to detect possible errors and ensure proper program functionality.

When submitting the code for evaluation on the Beecrowd platform, I was a little nervous, but confident in my work. Fortunately, the code passed all tests and the solution was accepted, which brought a feeling of satisfaction and confidence in my problem-solving and programming skills.
